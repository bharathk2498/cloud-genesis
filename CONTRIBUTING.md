# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to **Cloud Genesis**! We
welcome contributions from the community to improve the code, docs,
examples and workflows.  This document outlines our process and
expectations.

## How to contribute

1. **Check open issues** – Search the issue tracker to see if your
   feature or bug has already been discussed.
2. **Open an issue** – If your idea or bug is not listed, open a new
   issue.  Please provide as much context as possible and link
   relevant documentation.
3. **Fork and create a branch** – Fork the repository and create a
   descriptive feature or bug‑fix branch (e.g.
   `feature/aws-azure-networking`).
4. **Write tests (where appropriate)** – For scripts or modules,
   include unit or integration tests where practical.  Synthetic
   monitors in `validation/` are good examples.
5. **Follow the coding standards** – Use the editor settings
   specified in `.editorconfig`; shell scripts should follow `shellcheck`
   guidelines; TypeScript should conform to the included `tsconfig.json`.
6. **Commit with clear messages** – Write concise commit messages that
   explain *what* changed and *why*.  Use the imperative mood (e.g.
   `Add network plan schema`) and reference issue numbers when
   appropriate (e.g. `Fix #123`).
7. **Open a pull request** – Submit your PR against the `main` branch.
   Include a description of your changes, any relevant context and
   ensure that CI checks pass.  PRs must be reviewed by at least one
   maintainer before merging.
